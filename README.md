Datamining tool for SULFUR. Very much a work-in-progress. Requires a python development environment with `uv` installed. Eventually it will be packaged better and maybe I'll make some compiled builds.


```
uv sync
uv run src/unpack.py '0-9-12' --assetpath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SULFUR\Sulfur_Data"
```
